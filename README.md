**Stack Chan Features**

* Uses the web-based VOICEVOX for speech synthesis.
* You can choose between "Google Cloud STT" or "OpenAI Whisper" for speech recognition.
<br>

Google Cloud STT is based on "MhageGH"'s [esp32_CloudSpeech](https://github.com/MhageGH/esp32_CloudSpeech/ "Title").<br>
For the wake word, we used "MechaUma"さん's [SimpleVox](https://github.com/MechaUma/SimpleVox/ "Title") library.
